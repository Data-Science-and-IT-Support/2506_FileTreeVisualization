Perfect! Let’s go with Option 1: PyInstaller + pywebview, and I’ll guide you through a working setup that avoids the PackageNotFoundError and creates a standalone .exe.

✅ Step-by-Step Plan
1. Prepare Your Project Folder
Make sure your folder contains:

FileTree_App.py (your Streamlit app)
launch_with_webview.py (the launcher script I gave you)
A requirements.txt file with at least:
streamlit
pywebview
2. Create a PyInstaller .spec File
We’ll customize this to include Streamlit’s metadata.

3. Build the Executable
Use PyInstaller with the .spec file to generate a .exe.

🛠️ I’ll now generate the .spec file and update the launcher script if needed.
Analysis
✅ The custom PyInstaller .spec file has been generated successfully:

🚀 Final Steps to Build Your .exe
Install PyInstaller (if not already):


Build the Executable using the .spec file:


After the build completes, your .exe will be in the dist/launch_with_webview/ folder.

🧪 Test It
Double-click the .exe file. It should:

Launch your Streamlit app in the background.
Open a native window via pywebview.
Would you like me to generate a requirements.txt file too, or help you test the .exe?
