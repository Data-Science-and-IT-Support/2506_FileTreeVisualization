✅ 1. Where to Find the Compiled App
After running:

bash
Copy
Edit
pyinstaller run_app.spec
You'll see these folders created:

swift
Copy
Edit
/dist/run_app/        ← ✅ This is your deployable app folder
/build/
run_app.spec
Inside /dist/run_app/, you'll find:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
run_app.exe           ← ✅ This is the executable to run
<all other bundled files and dependencies>
▶️ 2. How to Run the App
On your development machine:
bash
Copy
Edit
cd dist/run_app
./run_app.exe
✅ This will:

Launch your FileTree_App.py via Streamlit

Open it in a native pywebview window

All in a self-contained manner

🚀 3. How to Deploy to Any Windows Machine
Option A – Manual Copy
Copy the entire dist/run_app/ folder to a USB stick, shared folder, or cloud drive.

On the target Windows machine, double-click run_app.exe.

⚠️ No Python needed on the target machine — it’s fully bundled.

Option B – Create a .zip or installer
🔹 To create a .zip:
bash
Copy
Edit
cd dist
powershell Compress-Archive -Path run_app -DestinationPath FileTreeViewer.zip
🔹 To create an installer (optional tools):
Inno Setup

NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System)

Advanced Installer (GUI)

These can:

Create a Windows installer .exe

Add a desktop/start menu shortcut

Handle silent installs

🧪 Optional: Streamlit Config
If you want to prevent Streamlit from showing the sidebar/hamburger icon, you can include this in .streamlit/config.toml:

toml
Copy
Edit
[browser]
gatherUsageStats = false
serverAddress = "localhost"
serverPort = 8501
headless = true

[server]
headless = true
runOnSave = false
Include it in your build by adding this to run_app.spec:

python
Copy
Edit
('path/to/.streamlit/config.toml', '.streamlit'),
✅ What to Share
You can give users either:

FileTreeViewer.zip and instructions to unzip & run run_app.exe, or

A custom Windows installer .exe

Would you like help generating a simple installer script too?
