st.write("Hi there, about this App: It was though as a weekend project. \n\n I wanted to organize my own files and photos in my computers.  I have many high capacity HD's and there are many duplicated files in the most unexpected places.  Sometimes they have the same content but the filename is different. Using the windows file explorer was not enough and more difficult than it should. \n\n Thus, I thought of making an app where I can see the file tree structure visually with more than one level down. I also wanted an excel, CSV or Dataframe file with the most important Information of the whole tree file, so I could compare file date creation, size, etc. making easier to identify duplicates. \n\n Of course knowing you file tree structure is also very helpful to understand your projects, repos, etc. It can be used also to explain a project structure to someone else, for example a colleage or a student. \n I may create a new version if needed; for this one I used streamlit as UI, which unfortunately does not have a file picker. \n That is why you just need to write in the input box the 'root'  (base) directory and then select your  choices of hidden, not hidden, how many levels down, etc. \n\n I hope is intituve enough, for any feedback please send me a message. My email is in my website: www.jesusbasail.com Where you will be able to download this app")
